Before Release 
==============

* [Martin] Use Genome Studio output to check Illumina's detection P-value method

* [Kasper] [DONE] Finish Manifest documentation

* [Martin] [DONE] Check if Welch-dof is still needed

* [Kasper] [DONE] Document the read.* functions

* [Martin] [DONE] Document plotCpG

* [Kasper] [DONE] Document (perhaps change name) Example Data

* [Martin] [DONE] Add examples to webpages use data(MsetEx), data(RGsetEx)

* Vignette rewrite
  - [Kasper] [DONE] move snp stuff into minfiLocal
  - [Martin] Better (perhaps much better) QC section
  - The manifest section should be in some kind of appendix
  - Clearer sections with Parsing/QC/Analysis/'Development'
  - Clear introduction for biologists

* DONE check slowness of vignette; can the qc plot be made better (faster)

* [Kasper] We need a NEWS file.


Various Stuff
=============

* [Martin] check why vignette is so slow; it is qcReport that is slow, and if
  so, which qc plot is the slow one.
   QC report timings for 24 samples:
    - qcReport 70s
    - densityPlot 18s
    - densityBeanPlot 32s
    - controlStripPlot 1s
    - msdPlot 3s
  Kasper: the qc timings are not so bad.  What takes time is repeated
  calls to getBeta(preprocessRaw()) in several functions.  This is
  perhaps hard to avoid in the vignette, but it should be fixable in
  qcReport, where it only ought to be computed once.  We may then
  perhaps speed up the vignette by calling qcReport.pdf and then
  include specific pages, instead of compiuteing the plot de-novo (?)
 
* a name for the Infinium set annotation and a get function as well.

* Question: when a probe is undetected, is it undetected on all
  arrays?  We are thinking about what happens if a probe is undetected
  only on a subset of samples; how should this be handled?  NA's

* Make function that plots the annotation track

* Add list of available functions to vignette


Interface to annotation masking and build selection
===================================================

Idea: mask certain loci and associate a genome build.  What follows is
a brian storm of the interface.

Annotation object
-----------------



Interface
---------

Idea: store masking in object, like
 genomeBuild(anno) = "36" 
 getLocusCoordinates(anno)
 maskLocus(anno) = "all"
 maskSex 

 newMask = unique(c(oldMask, newstuff))
 setdiff(cpgnames, maskedCpGs(anno))
probably better to use methylset than to use anno

Files that have been worked over
  AllClasses
  preprocess
  read.450k

Remaining
  qc : looks good, but we need more experience with looking at the qc
    report.  Perhaps one page per control probe type, perhaps only plot
    certain channels for certain control probes
  read.manifest (KDH) : needs to be updated to reflect new manifest structure
  utils: currently very little
  plot
  anno
  dmr



Analysis Interface
==================

plot a single CpG
plot a genomic region with multiple CpGs

differential methylation of single CpGs (currenly dmrFinder)
differential methylation of bigger regions, dmrs
  separation of fitting functions and results extractions

the ability to mask out certain CpGs because you don't want to see the
results

toptable
fit
plot.toptable



Completed tasks
===============
* [Martin] Download tables from UCSC (hg18 and hg19), document them and create
  Rda files with data.frames chr, start, end, name
  Rda files are always 1 based, _NO_ factors
  chr conventions "chr18", "chrX"
  New package genomeAnno in bitbucket
  scripts for doing all of this and comments or other documentation
  for download times etc.
